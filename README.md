# Darkweb-scriptcode
DeepTrace is an advanced Dark Web URL analysis tool that detects suspicious or illegal content by analyzing keywords and categories using semantic similarity models. It improves upon traditional keyword-matching techniques by integrating NLP models (DistilBERT) for context-aware detection, reducing false positives and improving accuracy.
-----Features----
Dynamic Detection: Identifies suspicious URLs using NLP-based semantic similarity.
Keyword-Based Detection: Includes predefined keyword matching for fast scanning.
Real-Time Scan Console: Displays analysis progress.
Dark Mode UI: Clean and user-friendly interface.
History Tab: Keeps track of previously scanned URLs.
Customizable Keyword Set: Allows admin to add/remove keywords dynamically.
